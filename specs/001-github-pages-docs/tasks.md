# Tasks: GitHub Pages Documentation Publishing

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-github-pages-docs/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: No xUnit tests required - documentation validated through build process (DocFX + LinkChecker)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Project follows single repository structure:
- Documentation source: `docs/`
- CLI project: `wt.cli/`
- Tools: `Tools/DocGenerator/`
- GitHub Actions: `.github/workflows/`
- Build output: `_site/` (not committed)

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Enable XML documentation and DocFX configuration

- [x] T001 Enable XML documentation generation in wt.cli/wt.cli.csproj (add GenerateDocumentationFile and DocumentationFile properties)
- [x] T002 [P] Verify docfx.json configuration exists and includes API metadata generation settings
- [x] T003 [P] Create Tools/DocGenerator/ directory and initialize console project with System.CommandLine package

**Checkpoint**: XML docs enabled, DocFX configured, DocGenerator project initialized

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core documentation infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T004 Implement command documentation generator in Tools/DocGenerator/Program.cs with MarkdownConsole and CommandDocGenerator classes
- [x] T005 Add ConvertCommandToMarkdown method to Tools/DocGenerator/Program.cs for System.CommandLine help text extraction
- [x] T006 [P] Create .github/workflows/docs.yml with release.published trigger and ubuntu-latest runner
- [x] T007 [P] Add DocFX installation step (dotnet tool install docfx --version 2.78.4) to .github/workflows/docs.yml
- [x] T008 Add version extraction logic (extract minor version from ${{ github.event.release.tag_name }}) to .github/workflows/docs.yml
- [x] T009 Create .github/scripts/update-version-manifest.py with version manifest update logic and JSON validation
- [x] T010 [P] Configure GitHub Pages deployment with permissions (contents: write, pages: write, id-token: write) in .github/workflows/docs.yml
- [x] T011 Add XML documentation comments to all public classes, methods, and properties in wt.cli/ (per FR-015 and SC-006)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - documentation can be generated and deployed automatically

---

- [ ] T042 [US3] Add version indicator to page footer in docfx.json template (display current version on every page per FR-007)

**Checkpoint**: Version switching functional - users can access documentation for any published minor version

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - API Reference for Developers (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Developers can find comprehensive API documentation for all public interfaces (SC-006, FR-005, FR-015)

**Independent Test**: A developer navigates to API Reference, finds a specific class, sees method signatures with XML comments, and successfully integrates it

**Checkpoint**: API documentation complete - 100% of public APIs documented and accessible

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - Contributing to the Project (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Contributors can set up development environment with 95% success rate (SC-005, FR-004)

**Independent Test**: A new contributor follows docs/contributing.md, sets up environment, runs tests, and submits a PR

### Implementation for User Story 5

- [ ] T051 [US5] Create docs/contributing.md with development environment setup section (prerequisites: .NET 10 SDK, Git)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel if team capacity allows
  - Or sequentially in priority order: US1 → US2 → US3 → US4 → US5
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Enhances US1 and US2 but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent

### Within Each User Story

- Tasks should be completed in order unless marked [P]
- User story is complete when checkpoint criteria is met
- Each story delivers value independently

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1**: T002, T003 can run in parallel
- **Phase 2**: T006, T007, T010 can run in parallel
- **Phase 3 (US1)**: T014, T015, T016 can run in parallel (different platform sections)
- **Phase 4 (US2)**: T023, T024, T025 can run in parallel (different command examples)
- **Phase 8**: T060, T061, T062, T063 can run in parallel

Once Foundational phase completes:
- **All 5 user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members**
- Each story is independently completable and testable

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Installation Guide)

```bash
# Launch all platform-specific sections together:
Task T014: "Add Windows installation instructions to docs/installation.md"
Task T015: "Add macOS installation instructions to docs/installation.md"  
Task T016: "Add Linux installation instructions to docs/installation.md"

# These can be written simultaneously by different team members
# Each section is independent and targets different file regions
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 (Command Reference)

```bash
# Launch all command example tasks together:
Task T023: "Add command examples for 'create' command"
Task T024: "Add command examples for 'list' command"
Task T025: "Add command examples for remaining commands"

# All modify Tools/DocGenerator/Program.cs but in different methods
# Can be developed in parallel with good coordination
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 & 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T003)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T004-T011) - **CRITICAL BLOCKER**
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T012-T020) - Installation Guide
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (T021-T029) - Command Reference
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test installation and command lookup independently
6. Deploy to GitHub Pages and validate with real users
7. This is the **minimum viable documentation** (SC-001, SC-002 met)

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation** (Phases 1-2) → Documentation infrastructure ready
2. **MVP** (Phases 3-4) → Installation + Commands → Deploy (satisfies P1 requirements)
3. **Enhanced** (+Phase 5) → Add version switching → Deploy (satisfies FR-006, FR-007)
4. **Developer Support** (+Phase 6) → Add API docs → Deploy (satisfies FR-005, SC-006)
5. **Community** (+Phase 7) → Add contribution guide → Deploy (satisfies FR-004, SC-005)
6. **Polish** (Phase 8) → Quality improvements → Final deployment

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Team completes Setup + Foundational together** (critical path)
2. **Once Foundational is done** (after T011):
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Installation Guide)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Command Reference)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Version Switching)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (API Reference)
   - Developer E: User Story 5 (Contribution Guide)
3. Stories complete independently and integrate via GitHub Pages deployment

### Single Developer Strategy

Follow sequential priority order:
1. Setup → Foundational → US1 → US2 → US3 → US4 → US5 → Polish
2. Deploy after US1+US2 for early user feedback
3. Deploy again after each additional story
4. Estimated total time: 4-6 hours for US1+US2, +1-2 hours per additional story

## Notes

- **No xUnit tests**: Documentation validated through DocFX build and LinkChecker
- **Auto-generation**: Command docs and API docs generated automatically (T004-T005, T021, T048-T049)
- **Version management**: Python script handles manifest updates (T009, T035-T037)
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions orchestrates entire workflow (T006-T010, T029, T038-T041, T048-T049, T060-T061)
- **Constitution compliance**: All gates passed (see plan.md Constitution Check section)
- **Performance**: Static site architecture ensures SC-007 (2-second load time)
- **Coverage**: API docs cover 100% public APIs per SC-006
- **Automation**: Documentation publishes within 10 minutes per SC-003

**Total Tasks**: 69 tasks organized into 8 phases (5 user stories + setup/foundational/polish)

**MVP Scope**: Phases 1-4 (32 tasks) deliver minimum viable documentation
**Full Scope**: All 8 phases (69 tasks) deliver complete documentation system

**Estimated Time**:
- MVP (US1+US2): 4-6 hours
- Enhanced (+US3): +1-2 hours  
- Developer (+US4): +1 hour
- Community (+US5): +1 hour
- Polish: +1 hour
- **Total**: 8-11 hours for complete feature

**Parallel Opportunities**: 15+ tasks can run in parallel, reducing total time by 30-40% with multiple developers
